Hi there! This is my twine story. It started out as a simple historical fiction narrative that dealt with religious interaction in Tudor England. 

I don't know if I accomplished that, but it gave me a chance to use various twine skills and put them to work. 

The contents of my repository are as follows:

.gitattributes, the initial commit of my respositiory (mini assignment 1)

Mini assignment 2, the bulk of my personal twine narrative.

Mini Assignment 3, where I uploaded images to my twine narrative.

Mini Assignment 4 where I inserted variables into my story. 

corrupted.html, a failed attempt to upload an image that resulted in an unreadable file.

Elizabeth.html, my commit of the group project.

and index.html, my version of hello world document

that's all folks!
